# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

test1 = []
for filename in os.listdir("../input"):
    filename_str = str(filename)
    test1.append(filename[:-4])
    for i in test1:
        
        test1[0] = pd.read_csv("../input/"+filename_str, encoding = 'latin-1')
